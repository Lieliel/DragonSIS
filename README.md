# Dragon Sales and Inventory System App

The Dragon Sales and Inventory System App is a project aimed at addressing the current issue faced by our client, Dragon M, who is struggling with the manual management of their inventory and sales. This project involves the development of an Android application that will seamlessly integrate into their existing management system, providing a more efficient and reliable solution for inventory and sales management.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a Sales and Inventory System App that will streamline the management of inventory and sales for Dragon M. By automating various tasks and eliminating manual processes, the system aims to ease the burdens associated with manual inventory management, reduce errors, and enhance overall security.

## Features

The Sales and Inventory System App will be designed to perform the following essential tasks:

1. **Add, Edit, Delete, and View Items:** The system will provide functionalities to easily add new items to the inventory, edit existing item details, delete items that are no longer required, and view the complete inventory.

2. **Price List Creation:** The application will allow users to create and maintain a price list for the items in their inventory. This feature will enable efficient pricing management and easy updates.

3. **Sales Recording:** The system will provide an interface to record sales transactions accurately and in real-time. This ensures that the inventory is updated promptly after each sale.

4. **Sales Reporting:** The app will generate comprehensive reports for sales, enabling Dragon M to analyze their sales performance over specific periods. These reports will provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making.

5. **Overall Inventory Report:** The system will generate a consolidated report for the overall inventory status, helping Dragon M to monitor stock levels and make informed restocking decisions.

## Technologies Used

The Sales and Inventory System App will be developed using the following technologies:

- **Android Studio:** The official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development.
- **Java:** The primary programming language used for developing the Android application.
- **XML:** Used for designing the app's user interface layouts.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight relational database management system used to store the application's data locally on the device.
